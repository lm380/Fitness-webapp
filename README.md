# Fitness-webapp
Spring boot fitness web application

## Current functionality

* Users (or clients as I reference them in the code) can sign up or sign in once registered.
* Users can update their nutrition information to update their nutrition targets
* Users can update their exercise targets to update their workout routine
* Users can add up to 10 exercises to their workout routine
* Admins have the same functionality as clients but can also view a list of users and modify or delete their accounts

## Using the web-app
* Please note that testing is not yet complete but please feel free to clone or download project and try it out.
* There is a sample admin account with username:'admin' and password:'123'
